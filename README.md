# Winter seasonal energy prediction
Skillful prediction of UK winter seasonal energy demand based on autumn climate information. Please find the data and python code for the MLR model and leave-one-out cross validation. Use UK_energy.py to run predictions, and the plotting script to create gridpoint analysis plots (remember to change file names and paths). Please contact for any questions or concerns.

Results plots and a poster presented at the 101st AMS meeting is also available.
