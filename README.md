# seasonal_energy_pred
Skillful prediction of UK winter seasonal energy consumption based on autumn climate information. Use UK_energy.py to run predictions, and the other scripts to generate respective plots, and, if neccessary, to process data (remember to change file names and paths). For the original NETCDF files that are too large to upload here, or any questions, please contact me. 

Results plots and a poster presented at the 101st AMS meeting is also available.
